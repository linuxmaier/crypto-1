Current Notes on Homework and Projects for the Course
=====================================================

Homework 1
----------

Submitted interim answers to check where I'm at. Got a few wrong, noted here:

1) Encrypted data doesn't compress well, so better compress first.

3) Gotta look at this again

5) Apparently, many constructions can have perfect secrecy. They will all be
less efficient than a OTP cipher, though

6) Adding a leading 0 does not affect the semantic security of the scheme.

8-10) Gotta do these sometime this week
